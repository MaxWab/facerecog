# impFaceRecognition

A Matlab implementation of Face Recognition using Sparse Representation from the original paper:

John Wright et al, "Robust Face Recognition via Sparse Representation", PAMI 2009.

In our implementation, we propose a Multi-scale Sparse Representation to improve the performance compared to the original paper.
